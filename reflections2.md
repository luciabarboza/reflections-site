Name at least one successful thing this week.

1. We were able to add a swiping feature to our main project's page where the user can swipe right to accept a city and left to decline a city.
2. We added a city scoring API which rates the city in terms of safety, housing, and travel connectivitity.
3. We updated our user preferences page UI and connected it to the backend of our website.

What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?

1. We had difficulties commmunicating on what was complete/in progress. We decided to do mini-standups every week so that we understood where everyone was at and how eveeryone was in general feeling about the project.
2. The swiping feature caused some lag in our website page but it is no longer lagging.

Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.)
1. We had some miscommunication in the beginning of the week which caused us to have to pivot our project's backend. After this, we had a much smoother sprint. 

Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?

1. I believe the Trello board really helped us plan and execute our project. We were able to add acceptance criteria and keep eachother accountable on whether or not something would be complete during our sprint. 

Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?

1. Currently, one stretch feature at risk is an AirBnB API where our users can find homes within their chosen city. We will plan to hopefully finish our MVP first before starting any stretch features.
