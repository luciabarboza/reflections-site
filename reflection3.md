1. Name at least one successful thing this week.

   This week we were able to combine all of our components to create a smoother user experience. We also got our APIs to display on the front-end. 
2. What were some challenges you and/or your group faced this week?
   This week, we faced the challenge of conditionally rendering the web application so it worked well for the user. 
3. Did you finish all of your tasks in your sprint plan for this week? If you did not finish all of the planned tasks what were some factors that contributed to this? (i.e over planned, did not know how to implement certain features, miscommunication from the team, had to pivot from original plans, etc.).
   Yes, we finished the tasks for this sprint. However, we did recieve a lot of feedback on things to improve so we will have to go back through our sprint and update those components. 
4. Did the resources provided to you help prepare you in planning and executing your capstone project sprint this week? Be specific, what resources did you find particularly helpful or which tasks did you need more support on?
   The Trello Board is very helpful is organizing our work and holding ourselves accountable. 
5. Which features and user stories would you consider “at risk”? How will you change your plan if those items remain “at risk”?
   One user story at risk would be where a registered user is able to update their preferences in a settings page. If we are close to the deadline and we cannot complete the page, we will maintain our MVP and avoid editing code that may break our application.
